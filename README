If you have 'Module::Build' installed, run:
  SHELL> perl Build.PL [installpath=...]
  SHELL> perl Build install

This works under both Win32 and Unix-like platforms.

The traditional MakeMaker approach is also available, though:
  SHELL> perl Makefile.PL [PREFIX=...]
  SHELL> make
  SHELL> make install
